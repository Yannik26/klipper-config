[output_pin power]
pin: !ar12
value: 1
shutdown_value: 0

[output_pin BEEPER_pin]
pin: ar33 
#   Beeper pin. This parameter must be provided.
#   ar37 is the default RAMPS/MKS pin.
pwm: True
#   A piezo beeper needs a PWM signal, a DC buzzer doesn't.
value: 0
#   Silent at power on, set to 1 if active low.
shutdown_value: 0
#   Disable at emergency shutdown (no PWM would be available anyway).
cycle_time: 0.001
#   PWM frequency : 0.001 = 1ms will give a base tone of 1kHz
scale: 1000
#   PWM parameter will be in the range of (0-1000 Hz).
#   Although not pitch perfect.
